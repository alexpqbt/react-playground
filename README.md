# react-playground

This repository is for practicing React in small exercises. Each exercise targets a single React concept or feature.

The plan will be following the React documentation as my starting point then branch off.

## Purpose

- Practice React incrementally
- Isolate one concept per exercise
- To not get overwhelmed; and
- To get my hands busy
